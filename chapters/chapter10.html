                        <p>The two bandits came forward, ropes swinging like leashes. Their eyes never left Merlin.</p>

                        <p>"Stop," I said, raising both hands. My voice came steadier than I felt. "He's not yours. Neither am I."</p>

                        <p>They didn't understand—or pretended not to.</p>

                        <p>I straightened, shoulders back, stepping in front of Merlin. At one-eighty and a hundred kilos, I loomed taller than they expected. Their steps faltered. One muttered to the other.</p>

                        <p>"Listen," I tried again, lowering my tone, softer now. "You don't want this fight. Walk away. Find someone else to rob. Nobody has to get hurt."</p>

                        <p>For a heartbeat, I thought it might work. Their eyes flicked between me, Merlin, and the bowman behind them. Doubt showed.</p>

                        <p>Then the leader barked a sharp word. The ropes came up.</p>

                        <p>One lunged. Instinct moved me. I sidestepped, caught his wrist, twisted. His balance went, and I shoved him hard into the stream. Water splashed high, his rope slipping from his grip.</p>

                        <p>The second snarled and swung wide with his rope like a club. I ducked, lunged low, and drove my shoulder into his chest. He staggered back with a grunt.</p>

                        <p>I was no fighter. No soldier. But I knew balance, leverage, and how to move my weight. For a moment, it was enough.</p>

                        <p>…The bowstring creaked.</p>

                        <p>I froze, one hand still fisted in the bandit's tunic. The leader's arrow was drawn, the point steady at my face.</p>

                        <p>"Down," he said. No bluster now. Just cold certainty.</p>

                        <p>Merlin growled, light flickering faintly in his chest, but I pressed a hand to his fur. He was too drained. If he surged again, it might break him.</p>

                        <p>So I let go, raising my hands. The bandits closed in, ropes ready.</p>

                        <p>I was outnumbered, unarmed, and far from home. Whatever came next, I couldn't stop it.</p>
