                        <p>Morning crept slow into the ravine, mist burning away to show the carcass half-picked beside the stream. I'd cut more strips, smoked what I could manage over the fire, wrapped them in scraps of hide. Merlin had eaten enough to wag his tail when I spoke his name. His chest glowed faint once in his sleep, steady as a pulse.</p>

                        <p>I was gathering stones when I heard it: not claws, not bandits, but a voice.</p>

                        <p>Humming.</p>

                        <p>A tune carried down the ravine, clear and careless, like someone walking without fear. I froze, hand on my club, body taut. Merlin stirred, ears pricking.</p>

                        <p>The figure appeared around the bend: a woman, tall, wrapped in a patchwork cloak, a basket slung at her side. She had hair bound in a long braid and boots worn smooth by miles. When she saw me, she stopped mid-step, eyebrows raised.</p>

                        <p>"Well," she said lightly, "you don't look like a bandit. And that's not a wolf."</p>

                        <p>Her eyes flicked to Merlin, who let out a tired rumble but didn't rise. She crouched slowly, set her basket down, and drew out a bundle of roots and flatbread. She held it out, palms open.</p>

                        <p>"No tricks," she said. "Hungry?"</p>

                        <p>The smell hit me—bread, spiced root, something clean. My throat tightened.</p>

                        <p>I didn't move. I kept the club in my hands, shoulders tight.</p>

                        <p>But Merlin did.</p>

                        <p>He struggled up, paws shaky, chest dimly glowing, and walked the few steps between us. She held her hand low, steady. He sniffed, then licked her palm once, tail giving a faint wag.</p>

                        <p>She smiled, soft and sure. "Smart beast. Knows who means no harm."</p>

                        <p>I still didn't lower the club. But Merlin pressed against her leg as though he'd known her forever, and for the first time I wondered if my mistrust was the weaker instinct.</p>

                        <p>Maybe, just maybe, this world held more than enemies.</p>
