                        <p>They loosened my ropes the next morning, enough that I could carry a bowl, sit, relieve myself. Not enough to run. A guard's eyes stayed on me no matter where I went, spear in hand, boredom masking vigilance.</p>

                        <p>Merlin remained tied to a post near the camp's edge. His rope stretched just far enough for him to lie in the dirt or rise to pace a circle. He rose when I approached, tail giving a slow wag before his body sagged again, still too drained. I knelt with him whenever I could, hand on his fur, whispering nonsense to steady us both.</p>

                        <p>It was no kindness that they let me walk the camp. It was assessment. I was stock, and stock needed to be kept fed, visible, worth the price.</p>

                        <p>The strangeness of it gnawed at me. Bandits should live lean—scatter, steal, scatter again. Instead I saw order. Loot stacked in crates, every one marked with chalk lines on a board. Children lined up with bowls, stew ladled in strict measures. Skins stretched on racks to dry, hides sorted, arrows fletched. A village disguised as thieves, or thieves who had become a village.</p>

                        <p>But a village couldn't survive on banditry alone. Not this many. Not this well. Something else sustained them. And every time I looked at the ropes around my wrists, or at Merlin tied like livestock, the answer sharpened.</p>

                        <p>Slavery.</p>

                        <p>Tov hovered near me as I ate, talking too much and too brightly. "See that one? Don't lend a knife to her unless you want it back chipped. That one there's always got a deck of cards, but the cards are marked. Don't ask how I know. And over there, that's where they keep the pit. Try not to end up in the pit."</p>

                        <p>He grinned, but his eyes stayed sharp, flitting from guard to guard. His chatter filled the space where questions festered.</p>

                        <p>At night they tethered me close to Merlin. He leaned against my side, still weak, still tired days later. His breathing slowed only when I stroked his fur, whispering under the noise of the camp.</p>

                        <p>I stared into the firelight, listening to the hum of a place that wasn't chaos at all. It was a ledger, every mark balanced against hunger. Goods, animals, people. And I was another line waiting to be tallied.</p>
