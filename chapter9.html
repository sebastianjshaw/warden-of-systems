                        <p>Morning came pale under the violet sky. The stream glittered, mist rising off its surface, and the air smelled of sharp grass and cold stone. For a moment I almost forgot we weren't home.</p>

                        <p>Merlin stretched, shook out his fur, then bounded into the shallows, sending water flying. His bark rang bright and foolish in the valley.</p>

                        <p>That was when the arrow hit the ground beside me.</p>

                        <p>The shaft quivered in the earth, its black fletching slick with some oily resin. I froze, the sound of the stream suddenly too loud, too exposed.</p>

                        <p>Merlin spun, growling low.</p>

                        <p>Figures stepped out from the treeline. Five, maybe six. Rough leather armor, faces smeared with ash, blades curved and ugly. Bandits, or their local equivalent. Their leader carried a bow still drawn, the next arrow aimed square at my chest.</p>

                        <p>"On your knees," he barked in a language I shouldn't have understood—but I did. The same way I had understood the summoners.</p>

                        <p>My heart hammered. I had no weapon. No power. Nothing.</p>

                        <p>Merlin growled, his hackles high, chest flickering faintly as though his body remembered the light but couldn't summon it.</p>

                        <p>The bowman's eyes flicked to him. His expression shifted, just for a heartbeat, to something like fear. Then it hardened again.</p>

                        <p>"Bind the beast first," he ordered. "Then the man."</p>

                        <p>Two of the bandits advanced, ropes in hand.</p>

                        <p>Merlin bared his teeth, ready to lunge. He'd give everything again if he had to—but he was still drained, still not whole.</p>

                        <p>I had seconds. Maybe less.</p>

                        <p>The peace of the stream shattered, and the world turned sharp and dangerous again.</p>
