                        <p>The ravine was narrow, its stone walls leaning inward, the stream at its floor whispering faintly. I carried Merlin until my legs gave out, then eased him down on a patch of grass by the water's edge. He lay still, chest rising in shallow pulls, the faintest flicker of light glowing beneath his fur before dimming again.</p>

                        <p>I knelt beside him, pressing my forehead to his. "You're alive," I whispered. "That's enough."</p>

                        <p>It had to be.</p>

                        <p>I pulled water from the stream in cupped hands, dribbling it onto his tongue. He swallowed weakly. I drank too, the cold shocking me back from the edge of collapse. My wrists burned from rope, shoulders raw from his weight, lungs scraped raw from running.</p>

                        <p>For the first time since the circle, no one pressed us forward. No chants, no horns, no laughter. Just stone, water, and breath.</p>

                        <p>Somehow, despite the fear and the fights before this, everything had carried a strange sense of play, as though we were all acting parts in a story I half-recognized. But hearing Merlin's cry when the Caller struck him tore that veil away. Now I understood this was not a game. This was life and death, as deep as marrow in my bones.</p>

                        <p>I leaned back against the wall, staring at the alien sky between the crack of stone above. Violet and green lights drifted like rivers across the heavens, a beauty I could not touch.</p>

                        <p>My thoughts circled the same truths. The Caller had known me. Had wanted me. Had summoned me. Merlin had stood against him—and been crushed. And me? I had pulled walls from stone, broken rope, split a fortress apart.</p>

                        <p>And then it was gone.</p>

                        <p>The Sight, the threads, the lattice—it had vanished the moment we were safe. No trace remained but rope burns and memory.</p>

                        <p>Which left me worse than powerless. Powerless and uncertain.</p>

                        <p>I sat in the dark until my breath steadied, then gathered stones to build a ring, dry grass for bedding. I had no tools, no food beyond what I could scrape from the ravine's edge, but I could make a place to rest.</p>

                        <p>Merlin stirred, pressing his muzzle against my leg. His eyes met mine, tired but unbroken. He trusted me still.</p>

                        <p>I stroked his fur. "Rest, buddy. I'll keep watch."</p>

                        <p>The words felt thin, but they were all I had.</p>

                        <p>The Caller would come again. His reach was long. But for tonight, in this crack in the world, Merlin and I were not prey, nor prize, nor stock. We were just alive.</p>

                        <p>And that had to be enough.</p>
