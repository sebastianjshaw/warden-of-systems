                    <h2>Character Development</h2>
                    <p>Characters in Warden of Systems grow organically throughout the story. Starting as a duo, the protagonist and Merlin have encountered new allies like Elira and faced formidable foes like the Caller as they navigate the magical realm.</p>
                    <p>Each character brings unique perspectives to the hard magic system, from the protagonist's awakening magical sight to Merlin's transformation, Elira's knowledge of ancient history, and the Caller's corruption of power. The story explores themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and the moral weight of wielding magical abilities.</p>
                    <p>Through 36 chapters, we've seen characters evolve from their initial states—the protagonist from ordinary person to someone who has crossed the line of killing, Merlin from simple dog to magical guardian, and Elira from cautious trader to committed ally in the fight against oppression.</p>
