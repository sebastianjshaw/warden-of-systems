                        <p>The goat track was no more than a scar cut into the stone, a zigzag that clawed upward from the ravine floor. Loose scree slid under every step. The wall leaned over us like it wanted us back in the dark.</p>

                        <p>Elira went first, basket bouncing against her hip. She moved like someone used to this kind of ground—quick but careful, hand always finding purchase in the stone.</p>

                        <p>Merlin and I lagged. He limped, claws scrabbling for grip, chest still dimly glowing as though each breath sparked a little fire inside him. I carried him when I had to, arms burning, ribs screaming where the grask had raked me. My club thumped against my shoulder, too heavy, too necessary to leave behind.</p>

                        <p>Every few steps I thought about falling. The track crumbled underfoot, stones rattling down into the stream far below. My stomach clenched at the sound.</p>

                        <p>We rested on a ledge halfway up, backs against the wall, chests heaving. Elira passed me a strip of smoked root. "Chew slow," she said. "Keeps your mouth wet."</p>

                        <p>Merlin pressed against my side, his tongue lolling. I gave him my share.</p>

                        <p>When I looked out across the valley, I forgot for a moment how much it hurt.</p>

                        <p>The world spread wide. Forests rolled in waves of green and gold, threaded with silver rivers. Hills climbed to jagged mountains streaked violet by veins of crystal that caught the sun. In the far distance, a storm drifted—dark, but its lightning arced in spirals, curling like serpents through the clouds.</p>

                        <p>Elira followed my gaze. "You get used to it," she said quietly. "The strangeness. Though some say you never should."</p>

                        <p>I said nothing. The sight filled me with awe and dread both. Beautiful, yes—but alien, untouchable, like I had been dropped into a painted dream I wasn't meant to see.</p>

                        <p>We pressed on. My legs shook. Merlin whimpered when I lifted him again, but he endured. The path narrowed, then widened, then finally broke onto the lip of the ravine.</p>

                        <p>We collapsed in the grass, flat on our backs, staring up at a sky burning with violet light and drifting stars.</p>

                        <p>Alive. Out of the hole.</p>

                        <p>Elira laughed, breathless. "Well. If you can do that half-dead, maybe you're worth keeping around after all."</p>

                        <p>I managed a grunt. Merlin wagged his tail once, as if in agreement.</p>
