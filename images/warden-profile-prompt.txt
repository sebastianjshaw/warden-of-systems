WARDEN PROFILE PICTURE PROMPT
==============================

A photorealistic portrait of a determined man in his mid-40s, wearing practical clothing from a farm background - worn jeans, sturdy boots, and a black hoodie. He is bald with a dark beard and intense, focused eyes that seem to see beyond the ordinary world. In his hand he holds a legendary sword (Excalibur) with an ancient, weathered hilt and a blade that gleams with inner light. His expression shows the weight of responsibility and the moral burden of having killed to protect those he loves. Behind him, subtle threads of golden light weave through the air, representing his ability to see the world's underlying balance. The lighting is dramatic but natural, with a mystical quality that suggests both his ordinary origins and his awakened magical abilities. High fantasy art style, photorealistic, detailed facial features, cinematic lighting.
