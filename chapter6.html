                        <p>We climbed.</p>

                        <p>The cavern narrowed to a jagged crack that stretched upward, a vein of pale light bleeding through. My arms shook with every pull, fingers slipping on damp rock, but the promise of open air dragged me forward. Merlin followed close, claws scraping, his breathing ragged but determined.</p>

                        <p>Then my hand broke through. Cold air kissed my skin. I shoved at loose stone, tearing at it until the gap widened enough to squeeze through.</p>

                        <p>I hauled myself out.</p>

                        <p>And the world hit me like a blow.</p>

                        <p>The sky was wrong.</p>

                        <p>Not black, not blue, but a swirling canopy of deep violet streaked with rivers of green light, as if the heavens themselves were alive. A crescent moon hung enormous and pale, its surface veined with cracks that glowed faintly like embers. Stars—if they were stars—burned too bright, shifting as though they moved of their own accord.</p>

                        <p>The land stretched endless beneath that sky. Jagged peaks clawed at the horizon, their slopes glowing faintly with veins of crystal. Forests sprawled in twisted shapes, trees with bark like iron and leaves that shimmered silver. In the far distance, a tower rose impossibly tall, piercing the heavens like a needle of shadow.</p>

                        <p>Merlin clambered up beside me, collapsing at my feet. The faint glow in his chest caught the alien starlight, making him shimmer. He looked out over the land, ears pricked despite his exhaustion.</p>

                        <p>I stood frozen, breath shallow. The air was sharp, heavy with scents I didn't recognize. The world itself felt alive, humming with power, every hill and valley whispering secrets I had no way to understand.</p>

                        <p>Behind us, the crack in the earth yawned black and silent. Somewhere in its depths, the Hollow Maw retreated to wait for the next unlucky soul.</p>

                        <p>I pressed a hand to Merlin's fur. He leaned into me, steady as ever.</p>

                        <p>"Alright, Boodles," I whispered. "New world. New rules."</p>

                        <p>The wind shifted, carrying a distant sound—horns again, but not the same as below. These were higher, sharper, the call of something organized. A city? An army? I couldn't tell.</p>

                        <p>All I knew was that we weren't safe yet. But for the first time since the fire circle had torn us from home, we could see the sky.</p>

                        <p>And that was enough.</p>
